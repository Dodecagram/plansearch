Important background, development and major milestones leading to modern RF/microwave transistors are first presented.

Coming slightly before was the discovery of the electron and of x-rays, but soon after came the revolution that brought in modern physics. The headline discovery is quantum mechanics, but experimentally the revolution enabled an understanding of what makes up atoms,leading to a new understanding of the subatomic world that has culminated in the recent famous discovery of the Higgs Boson. Modern physics has brought us an understanding of matter on a human scale (materials), and an understanding of the cosmos and of our beginnings. In this course I will put all these diverse discoveries into their historical context, showing how discoveries built upon earlier work, or sometimes came by accident.

It is an event in which a finite amount of charge is transferred from one object (i.e., human body) to the other (i.e., microchip). This process can result in a very high current passing through the microchip within a very short period of time, and more than 35% of chip damages can be attributed to such an event. As such, designing robust on-chip ESD structures to protect microchips against ESD stress is a high priority in the semiconductor industry. The continuing scaling of CMOS technology makes the ESD-induced failures even more prominent, and one can predict with certainty that the availability of effective and robust ESD protection solutions will be a critical factor to the success of the deep sub-micron technology advancement. In fact, many semiconductor companies worldwide are having difficulties in meeting the increasingly stringent ESD protection requirements for various electronics applications. This short course gives a comprehensive coverage on various important issues pertinent to ESD mechanisms and protection solutions, including ESD fundamentals, testing, design, optimization, and future challenges in BiCMOS and CMOS technologies. Outline:\n1. Overview of ESD (charge generation, damaging mechanisms, ESD standards, ESD protection schemes)\n2. Issues of ESD testing and measurements (testing equipment, transmission line pulsing (TLP) technique)\n3. Compact modeling of ESD protection devices 4.

This matter is often called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and it is believed to have existed during the first microsecond after the Big Bang. Therefore relativistic heavy ion collisions are also called the Little Bang. Major experiments are going on at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN - the European Organization for Nuclear Research near Geneva.From comparisons between the experimental data and results of theoretical models, we learn the properties of the QGP and deepen our understanding of the underlying theory of Quantum ChromoDynamics. Therefore it is essential to make simulations of the space-time evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions or events, and one major approach is using a transport model that evolves quarks, gluons, and hadrons. This short course will give an introduction to high energy heavy ion collisions, with an emphasis on their numerical simulations with a multi-phase transport model.

Because of its great success in providing knowledge about the nature and life, and the enormous penetration of technology developed based on science in economic and daily lives of general public, science and technology are important affairs in our society. On the other hand, scientific community has expanded tremendously since 1900, and the community is seeking huge financial resources from governments, industry, and the public to support research activities. Properly informed officials and citizens must be able to understand and critique science as well as support it. The healthy social dynamics within the scientific community is also essential to its adequate function. Issues like conflict of interest, ethical violation, misconduct and fraud in scientific research need to be identified and dealt with. In addition, for the benefit of the whole society, it is necessary for the scientific community to lead the public in the fighting against pseudoscience, science-denial and anti-science. Currently, scientific community should play a crucial role in resolving various urgent issues related to the sustainable development of human society.

In addition, the development in this research area is governed in some countries such as Germany by the renouncement of nuclear energy and the commitment to renewable energy sources (?Energiewende“). The world power demand is currently about 20 TW, about 10% of it is needed as electrical power. In the lecture course, we will discuss to which extend this demand for electricity can be satisfied or reduced by employing renewable and green energy technologies, in particular, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, wind power, or intelligent glazings. The evaluation is based on setting a 1 TW barrier threshold which should be overcome by each technology (as a mass product) based on a specific materials combination and deducing the amount of material, in terms of chemical elements, required to overcome this threshold. It turns out that the material resources required for many current device technologies are not sufficiently available. Some chemical elements which need to be considered scarce in this context are e.g. indium, silver, germanium, tellurium, or the rare earth metals. Other chemical elements should be avoided with regard to toxicity, examples are cadmium and lead. Possible ways of addressing the issues raised are to substitute the materials containing scarce chemical elements by other materials based on abundant chemical elements, e.g. replacing Ag by transparent n-type ZnO as material for contacts on solar panels, and to better plan the life cycle of the corresponding products (cradle to cradle) for a higher recycling rate of the chemical elements used. The art of designing and optimizing devices based on a periodic table restricted to abundant chemical elements will be discussed.The lecture course is interdisciplinary and touchesissues of economics, materials science, physics, and engineering.
