However,except for the exploration on spatial arrangement by Ming Dynasty artist Dong Qichang and a few experimental ink painters in recent years, pure abstraction and other modern, postmodern and contemporary pictorial organizations and approaches within the ink painting medium havenever been fully developed, which hinders the progression of ink painting and itsfull participation in the international contemporaryart world. Since the evolution of painting is partially judged by the compositional organization and the way the images are constructed,ink painting is often seen by the Western art critics as a traditional and ethnic painting medium unlike oil and acrylic mediums. On the one hand, for the vitality and liveliness of ink painting, we hope that this painting medium will continue to grow along with the development of our society into the postmodern world; on the other hand, since ink medium has many unique visual effects, concepts and philosophies that are related to and complement of modern Western art, we hope it will become a popular and vital medium internationally. With these intentions and expectations in mind, reformation and progression of ink painting medium become an important and crucial topic for discussion and exploration among contemporary Chinese artists. In order to nourish and facilitate such development, this course examines the concepts and techniques of abstraction, modernism, postmodernism, and other contemporary art forms in Western art history with an aim to help ink painters break free from the rigid constraints of the ink painting tradition. Experimental,creative, and individual artistic development in ink medium for each student will be emphasizedand multimedia approaches will also been encouraged and explored. Lecture, analysis, demo, reading,research, presentation, studio practice, artist statement writing, critical thinking skill, critique, and discussion will be the themes and methods of instructionin this course. Specific class projects include ppt presentation of his/her own portfolio, research of related artists and present the research to the whole class, discussion of critical essays, reviews, and art related videos, writing and critique of artist statement, individual and group critique of works in progress, etc. Students are encouraged to pursue a focused personal vision through a combination of self-directed studio practice and critique integrated with the study of historical and contemporary art theory.

Yet the prevailing painting style in China is limited to realism; explorations in abstraction, modernism, postmodernism, and other contemporary art forms have not been emphasized enough in the Chinese educational system, which hinders the healthy advancement of contemporary Chinese art. Apparently, since the evolution of paintingis partially judged by its compositional organization and the way the images are constructed, majority of the Chinese oil painting is considered conservative and traditional by Western critics, resulting in a limitedrecognition and participation in the international art world in major art centers such as London, Paris, Frankfurt, and New York. In order to nourish and facilitate such an experimental, creative, and individual artistic development among young oil painters in China, this course examines the concepts, techniques, and styles of abstraction, modernism, postmodernism, and other contemporary art forms in Western art history with the hope to help Chinese students go beyond classical representational painting style.
