Scientists, public authorities, corporations, citizens and groups around the world are all involved in a race to limit the adverse effects of phenomenon such as global warming, depletion of resources, desertification, increasing population and pollution, scarcity of fresh water and natural habitats, etc. Industrialization and choices made in relation to energy policy have long-term consequences on the future well-being of human populations and the ecosystems in which they live. Academic disciplines all play an important role in the search for solutions to those various environmental threats. The course will concentrate on the efforts that are made at the international level to tackle environmental challenges and risks through the adoption and formulation of norms between States. International Environmental Law presents itself as an emerging discipline which can help in the elaboration of constructive, realistic and acceptable alternatives to the business as usual scenarios. It can effectively counterbalance other State priorities such as economic and commercial growth in order to attain objectives of sustainability that have been put in place internationally through successive Earth summits. The law related to Sustainable Development offers a possible roadmap and some hope for a better future to many populations that are confronted with declining resources and increasing pollution. In 16 small chapters, the course will allow students to discuss principles and ideas that are central in the development of international environmental law. The theory and conceptual backgrounds of Sustainability, Preventive action of States, Polluter-pays and Precautionary principles, public participation in decision-making and other important parameters will be explained and explored through case studies. The students will also come to understand the formulation of norms in different regulatory regimes and the imperatives and constraints that can limit and shape legal action at the international level. They will become familiar to notions such as world summit, soft law, Treaty-law, Parties, State liability, International negotiations and forums, Conference and Meeting of the Parties, etc. The course will also be prepared with a focus on interdisciplinary understanding and discussion, as scientific, social, economic and other considerations are important in the elaboration of appropriate legal responses in the overall action to protect the environment.
