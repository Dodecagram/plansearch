Even though the method is rather well established in Western countries by now, it is still in its infancy in China. Laboratory experiments are an important and valuable tool to complement field studies for a number of reasons: the researcher is able to control the decision environment in a way hardly attainable in a natural setting. Behavioral data are gathered in experimental sessions where only the variable of interest is varied, providing a true ceteris paribus change. Observed differences in behavior can thus be attributed to the modification under study. Different from survey studies, experimental investigations are based on actual decisions associated with monetary rewards that are related to the participants’ choices. Laboratory experiments can serve as a ‘wind tunnel’ before institutional changes are implemented. Finally, experimental economics is well suited for cross-cultural and intercultural research as running experiments with exactly the same design in different countries allows to directly comparing behavior across cultures.\nThe course provides the main methodological requirements. It introduces basic economics experiments like the Ultimatum, the Dictator and the Trust game and will have students participate in own experiments.
