The course discusses how using green and blue infrastructure can create cities and living environments that are great places for people to live and work, but which also provide essential ‘ecosystem services’ that deliver significant environmental benefits, and which meet the severe challenges that face cities in the future, with a changing climate and expanding populations.  The course includes general background into the key environmental issues and challenges for future cities, and considers the theoretical background to green infrastructure planning, from large city scale, through to smaller site and plot-scale development. The course focuses on ecological urban design solutions with particular reference to a) urban stormwater management and flood management using green and blue infrastructure; b) promoting biodiversity and nature in cities; c) urban health: air and water quality, and the urban heat island and energy.  The course is uses many examples from the Professor’s own experience, research and practice.  An important theme of the course is the importance of design, and the integration of an aesthetic focus with ecological principles.  The course is a detailed overview of the related technologies of green roofs and rain gardens.  Both of these systems provide multiple environmental and human benefits, and are becoming common features of large European and North American cities.  Green Roofs are sited on top of buildings, living walls on the side of buildings, and rain gardens next to buildings.  All three systems are therefore closely related.  The course discusses the historical development of green roofs, living walls and rain gardens, and considers important examples from around the world.  Full technical information is provided about the design, function, and management of these systems.  Students will understand how they work, and the reasons for the benefits that they bring.  Special focus is given to the living components, plants and vegetation.  Also, there is discussion about how these systems are best adapted to the Chinese context, and what the important future developments might be with these technologies.The course is a detailed overview of the related technologies of green roofs and rain gardens.

Australian examples will be used throughout the course but class discussion and activities will explore similarities and differences across international boundaries.The course is based on ecological theory and will be presented in three sections. 1. Disturbance in Protected AreasThis section of the course focuses on ecological disturbance and its role within protected areas. It begins with an overview of disturbance ecology, the field of ecology that deals with disturbances in the landscape. Key aspects of ecological theory are derived from disturbance ecology. These include the concept of succession, the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, Dynamic Equilibrium and Gap Dynamics.Disturbance can also be a tool for managers and sometimes there is a requirement for managers of protected areas to introduce a disturbance in order to increase or maintain biodiversity or ecological functions.Fire is a key agent of disturbance in many parts of the world. Fire is considered here as an agent of disturbance and as a management tool 2. Visitor Management in Protected AreasThis section of the course examines the impacts of visitors and recreational use on the natural values of parks and reserves. The concepts of carrying capacity, acceptable impact and zoning are introduced.The public supports the protection and reservation of natural areas for various reasons. The interest and support of visitors, including local and international tourists, is very important to the continued provision of resources to properly manage our parks and reserves. However, visitors have impacts and managers need to avoid and/or respond to these. 3. Long Term Ecological Research and Natural Resource Management.This section of the course on Sustainable Management of Protected areas is intended to illustrate the value of long term ecological research and explain the integrated and adaptive nature of natural resource management. These separate concepts are considered together in order to provide a framework for students who may play a role in managing protected areas in the future.", "", "", "", "20150421实践周"], ["305839010", "The Conservation of the Modena World Heritage Unesco Site (Italy)", "The Conservation of  The Modena World Heritage Unesco Site (Italy)", "建筑与环境学院", "", "本科", "1.0", "16.0", "", "", "开设", "8.0", "16.0", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "国际周课程", "讲授", "Stefano Lugli", "", "", "Stefano Lugli", "Since the foundation of the Roman settlement in the year 183 BCE, the evolution of the Modena city has been challenged by floods and earthquakes.

The course is a discussion of “green” initiative efforts in cities around the world and follows a multi-disciplinary approach by integrating urban-focused concepts from history, sociology, ecology, geography, and architecture and planning.
